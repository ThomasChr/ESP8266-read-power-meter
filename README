Code to read a Power Meter over it's S0-Interface and stream it to your own Server.
It's possible to use Grafana to display the values in a nice manner.

There are the following files:
database.sql: The database Structure for the backend
grafana.txt: Textfile with the Grafana Querys
main.py: The Micropython Sourcecode for the ESP8266
README: This file
tempsensor.php: The backend PHP-Script to insert the data
tempsensorcheck.php: A file to check if all Sensors sended data in the last 15 minutes

PS: We're assuming a price of 27.88 Euro-Cent per kWh in the Grafana Querys.
PPS: The file "main_tempsensor.py" is an ESP8266 Node which uses an BME280 Sensor to get Environmental Data (Temperatur, Humidity, Preasure). It can also use the "tempsensor.php" backend.
